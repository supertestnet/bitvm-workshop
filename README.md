# How to use
[Click this link](supertestnet.github.io/bitvm-workshop/), open your web browser's console (ctrl+shift+i in firefox, otherwise Menu > More Tools > Web Developer Tools > Console), click Play, and follow the promps. They are a bit confusing so consider watching [this tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uurULEZr4PA) for assistance. And remember, this software is only half baked, so be prepared for disappointment
