# Bitvm workshop
Basic bitvm app that demonstrates 5 principles of bitvm:
- Multiparty computation
- State transfer
- Off chain computation
- Fraud proofs
- Tapleaf guards

# Warning
The code is a work in progress and doesn't fully work yet, do not expect much

# How to use
- Open up [Mutiny Textnet Tx Broadcaster](https://mutinynet.com/tx/push)
- And [Mutiny Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.mutinynet.com/)
- [Open bit tac toe by clicking this link](https://supertestnet.github.io/bitvm-workshop/)
- On the bit tac toe page, open your web browser's console (ctrl+shift+i in firefox, otherwise Menu > More Tools > Web Developer Tools > Console)
- Click Play and follow the promps. They are a bit confusing so consider watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwH9fhY4uGA) to see how it's *supposed* to work. And remember, this software is only half baked, so be prepared for disappointment
